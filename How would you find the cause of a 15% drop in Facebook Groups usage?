How would you find the cause of a 15% drop in Facebook Groups usage?


Clarify 
INTERVIEWEE: By usage, do you mean the creation of groups or user engagement or both?
INTERVIEWER: Strictly engagement.
INTERVIEWEE: Okay, how do you measure engagement? Is it by the number of posts created, the number of replies to posts, the number of reactions to posts, or the number of shared posts?
INTERVIEWER: All of those things. The total count of all those activities, or total engagement for Facebook Groups, has declined by 15%.


List High-level Reasons
INTERVIEWEE: Okay, at a very high-level the decline in engagement is due to:
1.Users creating, replying, reacting, and sharing fewer posts on Facebook Groups, and/or
2.Users going to an alternative feature.
To start diagnosing the cause of these behaviors, I would begin by asking the following questions to understand the context in which the decline in engagement was detected.


Gather Context Information
TIME: Is the decline in engagement a one-time event or has it happened progressively?
One-time event 
-> technology glitch (downtime in the services that support Facebook Groups) 
-> ask if there were technical problems that coincided
Progressive 
-> the cause is still there, we can dig deeper into data, which I will go through later

REGION: Is the decline happening in an isolated region?
TRUE 
-> country’s regulation, competitive product in that region 
-> do some studies on the population to understand their needs better, and I would consider developing features for those needs

PLATFORMS: Is the decline happening on specific platforms, like iOS, Android or others?
TRUE 
-> compare the drop of Facebook Groups engagement on each platform with engagement across all platforms
-> if overall engagement metric is steady
-> not worry much, users may switch platforms and still using Facebook Groups

OTHER FEATURES: is the decline in engagement happening in other Facebook features besides Facebook Groups?
TRUE
-> there is a much bigger problem, we would need to look at the overall engagement of the entire platform

COMPETITORS: Is the decline in engagement also happening in competitive products? 
The data is difficult to come by.
TRUE
-> the cause is also affecting other companies. This kind of problem would be out of scope for a product team and best handled by a corporate management team.


Establish a Theory of Probable Cause
Assume that the engagement is progressive, and none of the other situations are happening.
I would continue diagnosing what could cause users to behave in the two ways I described:
1. Creating, replying, reacting, and sharing fewer posts,
2. And, going to an alternative social-group feature.


Test your theories and Fix the Problem

Considering creating, replying, reacting, and sharing fewer posts, I would ask the following questions:
* Is there a problem with the creation of posts?
-> Maybe posts are created but not displayed on group members’ feeds. But this would cause sudden drop not progressive, so the probability of this being the cause is small.
* Are the notifications of new group posts working correctly?
-> Perhaps group members are not engaged because they are not getting notifications about new posts. But this would cause sudden drop not progressive, so the probability of this being the cause is small.
* Is there a problem with the UI for replaying, reacting or sharing of posts on Facebook Group pages?
-> If this were the case, I think users and the Q&A team would notice right away, and fix it. So, I do not believe this would be the cause of a progressive decline in engagement.
* Has there been an increase in spam posts on Facebook Groups?
-> Spam could cause users to leave groups, and be a possible cause of a progressive decline in engagement. Investigate this further and ask engineering team to check whether there are signs of cyber attacks and find ways to increase protection against those attacks.

In relation to users going to an alternative social-group feature, I would ask the following questions:
* Is there a new Facebook feature that is cannibalizing Facebook Groups?
  * What is the proportion of users of the new feature that are also users of Facebook Groups?
  * What is the percentage of users that switched that have showed a significant decline in engagement with Facebook Groups since the problem started?
  -> If this were the cases, it does not mean bad news. It is possible that the new feature brings more revenue to Facebook and adds more value to users.

* Is there a competitor of Facebook Groups that has increased its engagement numbers while Facebook Groups’ engagement decreased?
-> This internal data is hard to get. If it becomes public knowledge, I would find out what the competitor did differently. Then I would implement these new ideas on a test drive with a controlled group of users. If the new feature increased engagement, I would implement them.

In summary, my approach to finding the cause of lower user engagement of Facebook groups is as follows:
I started by understanding the context so that I could discard issues related to regions, specific platforms, side effects of other Facebook features, and marketing problems. Then, I dug deeper to identify what could affect user behavior to stop them from engaging. Of the six possible causes, I think the most plausible ones are: an increase in spam posts, cannibalization by another Facebook feature, and an external new competitive feature. I would test each of these probable causes to identify the exact source and then fix it.
